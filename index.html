            <p>I’m a Computer Science student heading into my final year, specializing in networking/cybersecurity, and
                software development.<br><br> I’ve always been drawn to the networking side of tech, I like the idea of
                understanding the
                unseen protocols that power the internet.
                <br><br>

                Through university I've built a solid foundation in:
            <ul>
                <li>Security+ Concepts and Practices</li>
                <li>Agile Software Development (Scrum)</li>
                <li>CCNA 2 - Switching, Routing, and Wireless Concepts</li>
                <li>CCNA 1 - Basics of Networking</li>
                <li>Operating Systems (xv6)</li>
                <li>Data Structures & Algorithms (Java)</li>
                <li>Object Oriented Programming (Java)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            I’m aiming for a career in security engineering, and I’m steadily building the programming skills needed
            to support that path.
